                    You will receive back the gold which you pledge with Muthoot
                    Finance after you repay the loan and the complete amount. If
                    you fail to repay the loan, then Muthoot Finance Ltd will
                    reluctantly auction off the same. The borrowers will receive
                    periodical reminders for payment of overdue interest and
                    after the tenure of the loan, a final Notice before the
                    auction.

                    from the branch where it was initially pledged as well as
