              Even before the word "ethos" had found a place in the corporate
              lexicon, Muthoot Finance Ltd. had imbibed a work culture that was
              based on conscience. Ever since its inception, the company has
              nurtured trust as its most prominent value. We are committed to
              keeping this heritage alive throughout the generations to come. At
              Muthoot Finance Ltd. we are committed to creating a balance. We
              believe in a simple yet profound theory of "from excess or scanty,
              to appropriateness".
